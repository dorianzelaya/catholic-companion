It is both a profession of faith and a sacramental blessing."

God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.

It is the most widely shared creed among Catholic, Orthodox, and historic Protestant Christians, although differences exist in its wording and use. In the Roman Rite it is normally proclaimed at Mass on Sundays and solemnities, with the Apostles' Creed permitted as an alternative in certain circumstances."

One popular explanation is that Christians were once hesitant to invoke him because his name resembled that of Judas Iscariot, although the historical origin of his patronage is uncertain. His feast is celebrated on October 28."
